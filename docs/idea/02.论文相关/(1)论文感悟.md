# 第一篇SCI的感悟和经验

## 摘要
因为研究方向是属于地理信息服务相关的内容，第一篇论文是利用动态服务来监测地表覆盖变化模型，我们提出了一个DSCM模型，它可以封装桌面算法为Web服务。
![](img/(1)论文感悟/img-2023-01-21-11-55-43.png)

## 1.实验部分
在此记录一下整个论文的流程，实验部分在2021年上半年，陆陆续续的在ILCS系统里集成变化检测的模块，主要工作有几个：

1.GUI的设计与开发，用到了一些组件,如Antd、拖动面板Panne、Openlayers、DAR流程图等

2.PCA、CVA、OTSU、KMeans等算法的开发、测试、编译、部署等

3.将算法整合到ILCS中，并暴露接口

4.数据处理：用ArcGIS Model BUilder 脚本批量处理了GLobeLand30数据集，放在Tomcat中这样可以通过http的方式来调用，同时在GeoServer中使用ImageMosic工具将多期多个影像发布为服务，通过CQL可以按需进行查询。

5.前端地图交互功能，画框框选内容，这样可以查询到我们选中的数据，并进行交互。

## 2.论文撰写
论文的初稿是七月份和八月份在咖啡厅完成的，其中在论文撰写的同时同步修改实验内容，数据等。
九月份回校后将论文翻译成英文，受限于英文水平，先用Google翻译一句一句翻译，再使用QuillBot Al进行句式的优化，**在英文表达中，使用被动句要多。** 就这样完成整个论文的撰写后，再使用语法纠错工具Grammarly进行差错，把错误的语法更正。
十月份一直到十二月底一直在修改论文并和导师讨论。

初稿两个月，修改三个月。

Introduction的一个思路：
1. 说明重要性，解释一下
2. 背景信息，或者下定义
3. 加入更多信息，引入参考文献
4. 说明缺点
5. 进一步描述缺点
6. 描述现有研究是如何解决这个问题的
7. 几个领域的重要文章
8. 总结现有研究的不足，空白
9. 描述本文方法提出弥补空白
10. 引出自己的方法
11. 研究的主要结论

还要感谢程宝和贾楠师姐帮我看论文🙏，俺英语是在太差了。

修改意见更多的还是老师提，然后我来修改这样。比较细碎，就不多说了。

## 3. 论文插图
论文插图需要注意几个点就可以：

1. 配色
2. 图的质量
3. 图中组件和组件之间的位置、间距是否合适等
4. 组图的话每个图要有小编号和名称
5. 整体美观和谐

一般的绘图软件都可以满足，我用的是一个开源软件draw.io，很轻量级。
## 5. 期刊和投稿
投稿的工作基本也是老师来投的，老师是拿一作，投的时候还有点突然，本来以为还要改几轮，一开始投了ELSEVIER，后来好像没有被送审。第二次是MDPI下的RemoteSensing期刊，Geospatial Big Data and AI/Deep Learning for the Sustainable Planet这个Special Issue。
Remote Sensing的审查还是很快的，前后十天意见就返回来了。
感觉编辑还是能接受的，感觉问题应该不大。
![](img/(1)论文感悟/img-2023-01-21-11-57-46.png)
## 6. 第一次评审意见
三个审稿人在Round 1 分别提出1条、3条和18条的建议，感觉几个人都是更偏向于做变化检测的，共同点是都对数据没有精度验证提出了质疑，因此在修订版中加入了精度评价内容。

感谢大师姐朱林烨教我作精度评价，ENVI好久没用了，哎。
1. 加载图像
这里加载是使用程序或者人工解译分类的.tif图像，当然也可以是ENVI的.dat格式,加载后的原始图像并不能做精度评价，需要转换其为ENVI的class image放可进行精度评价，计算混淆矩阵。
2. 进行彩色密度分割
我用的是二值图，因此分0和1 就可以了 0to1 和1to1.tif右键然后New Raster Color Slice
3. 使用ROI工具建立验证样本集
这个如果没有样本的话要自己画，对比两期影像。选择Unchange和change的样本。
4. 使用混淆矩阵工具评价分类精度
Confusi on Matrix Using Ground Truth ROIs工具，输入彩色密度分割的图像，然后选择对应的change和unchanged 就可以得到OA、Kapaa，错检率，漏检率等。
![](img/(1)论文感悟/img-2023-01-21-12-05-47.png)
在回复意见的时候，还是要仔细回复，前后意见和老师讨论了三次，修改了三次，能在文中修改的就修改，修改不了的要好好回复审稿人。
![](img/(1)论文感悟/img-2023-01-21-11-56-20.png)

腊月二十七，修订版提交回去。
目前的状态：Revised version review
## 7. 校稿
还没到这一部分，做了再来写！
现在是2022年大年30，十二点零六分，新年快乐！🎆

    2022.1.31更新

目前论文已经在线发表了，校稿首先按编辑的要求进行修改，大部分内容需要确认，少部分修改，有一些地方编辑也会帮你改好再需要你确认一下。
校稿返回去以后又返回了一次，原因是组图的小编号和内容没有对应起来（中间经过了一次图片的修改）

之后就在线发表了，24小时的时间可以在网站上确认内容是否有误，之后就发表了。
